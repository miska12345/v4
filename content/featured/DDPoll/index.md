DDPoll offers users the ability to create and participate in polls based on their geographical regions(i.e. Seattle).
It was built to foster a sense of local community for Q&A, advice, and more.
DDPoll is designed to support a large number of concurrent users and poll activities, utilizing the benefits of Goroutines and in-memory caching.
