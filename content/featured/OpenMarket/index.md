OpenMarket offers organizations a new way to create, distribute, and exchange virtual currencies (stamps) through event check-ins and gift shopping, helping organizations to boost their event participation by providing a virtual, monetary incentive for their participants.
The project was created in response to the observation that student clubs were struggling to find enough participants for their virtual events due to the lack of incentives.
