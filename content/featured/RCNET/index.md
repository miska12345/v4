A remote control framework for robotic cars and IoT devices. It offers a set of tools, namely APIs and GUI, for building simple, interactive, and Wi-FI enabled features with NodeMCU microcontrollers(i.e. ESP8266).
The GUI can be used to control, monitor, and automate the NodeMCU device, which means that the developer no long need to spend time building these basic functionalities, and can spend more time building what they truly love.
The project was created to help high school students learn about robotic car programming, and it had been adopted by Seattle University Department of Electrical Engineering for their summer coding camps.
