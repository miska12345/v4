A cross-platform Remote File Manager (RFM) that offers users the ability to manage (read, write, upload, and download) files stored on a remote computer using the command prompt.
Traditional softwares for remote file management typically require the remote computer to expose a port to the public internet through port forwarding.
With MiskaRFS, no port forwarding is necessary for remote file management. It achieves this through a technique called relaying.
This project was created as an exercise for using the Go programming language.
